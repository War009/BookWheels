# Library Management System
End Semester Project

# Overview
The Library Management System is a Java-based application designed to streamline library operations, including book management, user interactions, and borrowing processes. This README offers insights into the project's code structure, design principles, and implementation details.

# Code Logic Overview
The system consists of multiple classes and interfaces responsible for handling various aspects of library management:

### Person:
Abstract class representing individuals interacting with the system, facilitating user registration, login, and profile management.
### Librarian and Borrower:
Concrete subclasses of Person, distinguishing between librarians responsible for managing the library and borrowers borrowing books.
### Book:
Class representing a book with attributes such as title, author, availability status, and borrowing information. Includes methods for book management and search.
### BorrowingRecord:
Class representing a record of book borrowings, including borrower details, borrowed book information, and return dates.
### LibraryManagementSystem:
Main class coordinating library operations, user authentication, and book borrowing processes. Manages book catalog, user records, and borrowing records.

# Approaches Used
### Object-Oriented Design:
The project adheres to object-oriented design principles, ensuring modular, encapsulated, and reusable code components.
### Interface Segregation:
Interfaces like UserOperations and BookManagement define specific sets of operations, promoting flexibility and decoupling of modules.
### File Handling:
Java's file handling functionalities are employed for storing and retrieving user, book, and borrowing data persistently.
### User Authentication:
User authentication is implemented by validating user credentials against stored user data, ensuring secure access to the system.

# Technologies Used
1. Java
2. Java File I/O
3. UML for system design visualization

# Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
3. Run the Main class to launch the Library Management System.
4. Follow on-screen instructions to register as a librarian or borrower, manage books, search for books, and borrow/return books.
